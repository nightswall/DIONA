# DIONA

DIONA is an attack detection system that utilizes deep learning technology to detect security threats anomalies that a normal attack detection system cannot.

## Architecture

DIONA consists of three layers:

1. **Fog Layer**: Contains the IoT swarm and the IoT gateway
2. **Security Layer**: Contains a static IDS
3. **DL Engine Layer**: Contains an advanced DL powered anomaly detection system.
